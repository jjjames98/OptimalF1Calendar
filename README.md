# OptimalF1Calendar
Python script that calculates an "optimal" F1 Calendar based on distance needed to travel between each circuit given a user-defined list.

A common concern among F1 fans, given F1's official pledge to "Net Carbon Zero" by 2030, is that the distance travelled between each circuit on the F1 calendar causes
more than necessary carbon emmissions. An example of this in the 2023 Calendar is the start of the season where the first two races are in the Middle East, then to
Australia, then back to East Asia-Western Europe region with Azerbaijan, followed by a race on the east coast of the US and then back to Europe with the next races 
in Imola and Monaco. Many F1 fans believe that to solve this the order of races should be decided by their geographical distance from each other.

This python script takes a user-defined list of circuits (preferrably in order of date raced at) and generates a new order that is determined the next closest
circuit to the previous circuit. This will create an "optimal" F1 calendar in regards to reducing carbon emissions generated by travelling between circuits.
